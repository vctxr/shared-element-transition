iOS app that mimics App Store's Today page custom transition. Built using UIKit framework without any third-party dependencies. I built this app inspired by Andrei Blaj's ([link to his profile](https://github.com/andrei-blaj))  implementation on the same topic but with my own take with added modification and changes to make it even more awesome 😎.<br><br>
> **Note:** You can see **Kura** app from the list of app cards. It is actually a real iOS app that my team and I developed during our time in Apple Developer Academy. Kura has not been published to the App Store **yet** (Just waitt 😆), but is published to TestFlight.
